# homebrew-wine
This repository contains wine related casks/formulas.\
![Downloads count](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/gcenx/homebrew-wine/total.svg)

## formulas;
- `cx-llvm`     *(custom llvm|clang-8 toolchain for -mwine32 targets)*
- `tapi`        *(Apple tapi-1100.0.11)*
- `winetricks`  *(20221108)*
- `wine-crossover@19` *(wine-4.12.1)*
- `wine-crossover@20` *(wine-5.0)*
- `wine-crossover@21` *(wine-6.0)*

### To install the `winetricks` package;
```
brew install --formula gcenx/wine/winetricks
```
_The custom `winetricks` verb uses my fork that's aimed at macOS_

<br>

## casks;
- `portingkit`
- `unofficial-wineskin`
- `wine-stable-legacy` *(wine-7.0 without [bug 52354](https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52354))*
- `wine-crossover`     *(wine-7.7 [crossover-sources-22.0.1](https://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/source/crossover-sources-22.0.1.tar.gz))*

### To install the `wine-crossover` package;
```
brew install --cask --no-quarantine gcenx/wine/wine-crossover
```
This will install `Wine Crossover` into `/Applications` and function as the official brew cask would.\
The `--no-quarantine` flag is required so brew skips the quarantine flag that causes Gatekeeper to believe `Wine Crossover` is broken.

## wine-gecko is included;
`wine-gecko`is included within these custom `wine-crossover` package(s), usually wine(64/32on64) will download and then install .msi packages into each and every wineprefix increasing prefix size instead the "shared" packages are used to reduce prefix size.

## Don't open issues on Winehq!;
`wine-crossover` is not an upstream package.\
As Iâ€™m not too familiar with brew any issues with the provided casks/formulas should be reported here.
